# Free Java Course

I will be adding code from Home And Learn's Free Java Course to this repo.

The course can be found at [http://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/java/java.html](http://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/java/java.html).

Note that this repo is merely for documenting my source code. The snippets were ran in the NetBeans IDE.
